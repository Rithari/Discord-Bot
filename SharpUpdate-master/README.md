# SharpUpdate
SharpUpdate is written in C#. It reads a xml file on the server that contains update information such as version, MD5, and update log, download the update, close the current app, and open the updated app in 5 seconds.

[Note 1] This is used and further improved in the project SimpeEpub2. The improved version supports DotNetBar UI framework, multilingual UI, high DPI etc. If interested, please check out SimpleEpub2 by visiting https://github.com/henryxrl/SimpleEpub2

[Note 2] To create the xml file automatically (i.e, a UI for user-input update log, update date filled automatically, MD5 checked automatically etc), please check out "GenereateUpdateXML" project, which is a sub project under "SimpleEpub2".
